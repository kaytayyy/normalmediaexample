Notes by the developer: I needed a something to work on and I knew that this was the perfect project to try out some of my skills. I asked if I could make a website for Normal Media and was given the opportunity to, as well as a general layout of the website. I have run every aspect past this company and have gotten approval and feedback, trying to make their dream a reality as well.
